# JSF - Login 

This is a sample application to demonstrate knowledge with JSF, Spring, and Hibernate. 

I have utilized these three frameworks in conjuction with Tomcat 9.0, Java 15, and MySQL to create a working login and registration form, with success and error handling. 

Under resources, there is a sql script which will set up the database for the application.
